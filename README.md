Events Registration App Overview Web-based application for events registration.
There are three complexity levels: base, middle and advanced. The base level is
sufficient to pass the test task stage. Still, accomplished tasks with a harder
level of complexity will highly increase your chance of getting to the school.
Requirements

- Add the level of accomplished tasks in the README.md file.
- Upload source code to GitHub/BitBucket/GitLab and share a link.
- Host an application in any preferable way and share the URL to access it.
- The front-end part must be done in HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with or without any
  framework), with any preferred design style.
- The back-end part can be done in NodeJS with or without any framework.
- Use any relational or non-relational database. Base level
- Events board page: implement the events board page where users can observe the
  paginated list of available events. List of events can be pre-populated in the
  database manually or via seed script. Event should consist of:
- title;
- description;
- event date;
- organizer;
